      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>The Employer Assessment Guide has traditionally been provided as a text-heavy Word/PDF document for BBA practicum students. While functional, the static format created challenges in navigation, long-term maintenance, and student engagement. Content updates required manual file replacements, and students often struggled to quickly locate relevant information during their practicum journey.</p>
      <p>To address these usability and operational issues, the project—developed in collaboration with the SAIT School of Business—aims to convert the existing document into a structured, interactive Brightspace experience. By transitioning to a digital, modular format, the project leverages Brightspace’s built-in tools to centralize content management, reduce administrative workload, and improve accessibility for all BBA students.</p>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>The primary goal is to transform the previously static Employer Evaluation Guide into an intuitive, visually driven, and easily navigable digital resource integrated directly within Brightspace. The redesigned experience aims to:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>Improve usability and readability through modular layouts, icons, and visual elements.</li>
          <li>Enhance engagement with interactive components suited to Brightspace (e.g., collapsible sections, progress indicators).</li>
          <li>Centralize maintenance and ensure consistent, secure, and compliant content updates.</li>
          <li>Provide BBA students with a streamlined guide that supports their practicum success.</li>
        </ul>

     <h3>Skills</h3>        
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>UX Research & Analysis: Conducted content and usability analysis of the original Employer Evaluation Guide to identify navigation, readability, and accessibility issues. Gathered insights from practicum coordinators and student workflows to clarify key user needs.</li>
            <li>Information Architecture: Transformed the text-heavy document into a structured, modular content system. Created a clear hierarchy to support quick scanning and step-by-step learning.</li>
            <li>Interaction & Visual Design: Designed intuitive layouts, icons, and visual elements aligned with Brightspace requirements. Applied accessibility standards to ensure clarity, contrast, and consistency for all users.</li>
            <li>Figma Prototyping: Built high-fidelity interactive prototypes in Figma to visualize the redesigned Brightspace experience. Used Figma’s auto-layout, components, and version history to ensure consistency and efficient iteration.</li>
            <li>Content Strategy & UX Writing: Rewrote complex or lengthy text into concise, student-friendly, and easy-to-navigate microcopy. Ensured tone and structure support student understanding and reduce cognitive load.</li>
            <li>Design Collaboration: Collaborated with coordinators and team members to validate content accuracy and align design decisions. Incorporated feedback through iterative design rounds using Figma comments and version tracking.</li>
            <li>Technical Awareness: Designed with Brightspace constraints in mind, ensuring layouts, visuals, and interactions are feasible within D2L’s environment. Prepared content and asset guidelines to support smooth implementation inside the LMS.</li>
             </ul>
